## Socket Programming Implementation

### Running the Code:

#### C Implementation
- COMPILATION : In C/Client :
```
gcc -o client client.c
```
- COMPILATION : 	In C/Server :
```
gcc -o server server.c
```
- Running Server in C/Server:
```
./server <port_number>
```
- Running Client in C/Client:
```
./client localhost <port_number> <filename>
```

#### Python Implementation

- Running Server in Python/Server:
```
python server_persistent.py
# or
python server_nonpersistent.py
# As required
# Enter the details asked after this, the code is verbose
```
- Running Client in Python/Client:
```
python client_persistent.py
# or
python client_nonpersistent.py
# As required
# Enter the details asked after this, the code is verbose.
